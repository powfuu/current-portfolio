## Architecture

<!-- Describe the high-level architecture: main components, data flow, key boundaries.
     Update this when structure changes. -->

## Approvals

<!-- Authoritative list of approved dependencies. Check before adding anything new. -->

| Library / Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|---------|
|               |         |         |

## Rules (non-negotiable)

1. Read `docs/features/<feature>/requirements.md` BEFORE implementing any feature.
2. Write tests before marking a task as complete.
3. Check **## Approvals** before adding any new dependency.
4. Keep this file updated when the stack or rules change.

## What NOT to do

- Do NOT add libraries not in **## Approvals** without updating it first.
- Do NOT commit to main/master directly — use feature branches and code review.
- Do NOT skip requirements.md when starting a feature.
- Do NOT change architecture without updating **## Architecture** in this file.
